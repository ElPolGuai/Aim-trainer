# Aim trainer
Aim trainer made with pygame (Python Module)

Hello, I am Pol Com√≠ and I really enjoy python and pygame.

These days I have been creating an aim trainer for those who want to improve their skills on FPS games and maybe learn more about coding while doing so. It generates some targets that you have to click in a 1-minute-timer. After that, it shows your score, misses, accuracy etc in a nice menu.

Hope you like it!
